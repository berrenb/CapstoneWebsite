        Hello Internet! My name is Bryan and I am just beginning my 4th and final year at SUNY Poly. It feels like it was only yesterday that I moved in as a freshmen. I am super excited to share with you part of my capstone project. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For starters, I am working on a Dual Major in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems with a minor in Network and Computer Security. I've had a passion for computers for as long as I can remember. It may seem like a lot of work, but I enjoy every minute of it.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I'm not staring at a computer, I love to waste my money in my bank account on baseball games (Let's Go Mets!), football games (Let's Go Giants!), movies, or Applebees. I also love going outside with friends playing tennis, spike ball, baseball or anything we can think of. I love being around friends and family whenever I can.
        <br>
        <br>
        Speaking of family, I am one of three siblings. I have an older sister, Brittany and a younger one, Alyssa. I also can't forget about my amazing shih-tzu, Molly. She's one of those dogs where if you walk through the door, she'll run to you and will want you to play with her. With my family, I love going on trips such as Disney or Punta Cana.
        <br>
        <br>
        To wrap things up, I'm excited to interact with some of you as my website continues to grow. Feel free to start a discussion with me if something interests you. Take care!
        <br>
