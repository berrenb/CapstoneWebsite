            Hello Internet! My name is Bryan and I am just beginning my 4th and final year at SUNY Polytechnic Institute. It feels like it was only yesterday that I moved in as a freshmen. I am super excited to share with you part of my capstone project.
            <br>
            <br>
            For starters, I am working on a Dual Major in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems with a minor in Network and Computer Security. I've had a passion for computers for as long as I can remember. It may seem like a lot of work, but I enjoy every minute of it.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my spare time, I enjoy going to baseball games (Let's Go Mets!), football games (Let's Go Giants!), movies, or Applebees. I also love going outside with friends playing tennis, spike ball, baseball or anything we can think of. I love being around friends and family whenever I can.
            <br>
            <br>
            Speaking of family, I am one of three siblings. I have an older sister, Brittany and a younger sister, Alyssa. I also can't forget about my amazing Shih Tzu, Molly. She's one of those dogs where if you walk through the door, she'll run to you and will want you to play with her. With my family, I love going on trips such as Disney or Punta Cana.
            <br>
            <br>
            To wrap things up, I'm excited to interact with some of you as my website continues to grow. Feel free to start a discussion with me if something interests you. Take care!
